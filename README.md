# ArtificialLife

Artificial Life is a reinforcement learning simulation for animal behaviour. Using PyGame a simple environment is built where an animal is governed by depleting metricss of food, water, and energy. During the day the animal must forage to replenish its food and water, and at night it must return to its shelter to regain energy. Initially a human plays and a data set of 16 input variables is created where every quarter of a second a line data is added based on distance and angle to food, water, and shelter, current food, water, and energy metrics, and also the time of day. The classification for each line of data is the input direction chosen by the player. Using Random Forest or a Multilayer Perceptron in TensorFlow, the program inputs a saved pickle or checkpoint which controls the animal's movement. Every time the model beats its top score the model adds its move set to the dataset and retrains the network. This process is repeated and the model continually improves through trial and error as it improves its score.
